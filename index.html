								<h3>The Problem</h3>
								<p>Due to coronavirus many schools will have trouble raising money for computers during the fall. Many parents will be out of a job and not have enough money to spare for donations.  With advances in technology moving very quickly, many school computers are becoming very slow and obsolete. PCs are getting more use at schools than ever, and need regular upgrades.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="6u">
							<section class="special">
								<h3>The Solution</h3>
								<p>We are looking to raise money to buy parts and then assemble them into functional PCs that can be used in schools for the 2020-2021. We will then be donating the PCs we make to schools and other organizations in need across the Bay Area. We hope to reach as many students affected as possible. </p>

					<h2>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h2>
					<p>With the help of your donation, PCsforStudents will build and donate PCs to schools in need. This will help the schools have access to more computers and help replace their obsolete ones.  We will make sure that the PCs that we build will be in the hands of schools in low income areas where they are in need of computers.</p>

						<div class="4u">
							<section class="special box">
								<i class="icon fa-area-chart major"></i>
								<h3>Purchase Parts</h3>
								<p>We begin by raising money to buy parts. Parts can get pretty expensive, as our total cost for one computer totals to around 383 dollars before tax. A detailed list of our exact spec can be found on our gofundme page. Our computers have the latest CPU technology from Intel and are built to last for more than 5 years.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<section class="special box">
								<i class="icon fa-cog major"></i>
								<h3>Assemble PCs</h3>
								<p>We have a team of people ready to assemble these computers. Our assembly includes a licensed operating system from Microsoft. We have an extensive background in building windows based systems and experience in computer hardware, making sure these computers are safe and useful.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<section class="special box">
								<i class="icon fa-refresh major"></i>
								<h3>Connect Schools to PCs</h3>
								<p>We connect with schools across the Bay Area and other organizations to reach as many students as possible. We deliver a complimentary keyboard and mouse with each computer donated. These computers will be used daily at schools and are vital to the students education.</p>

								<h3>Dhruv Kerai</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Hi I'm Dhruv, a sophomore at Cupertino High School. I am passionate about computers and I enjoy giving back to my community. I have built multiple windows based systems for family and friends over the past 3 years and I have a lot of experience upgrading my own personal computers. I also have extensive knowledge about computer hardware and the way it works. I am very driven and I am completely focused to make this project work so that students have access to good quality computers which will last many school years.</p>

								<h3>Chaitra Raghupathi</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Hi I'm Chaitra, a sophomore at Monta Vista High School. I see the growing neccesity for computers in education and believe nothing should come in the way of that. Connecting and helping people in need is something still possible in the time of a pandemic and by donating computers to schools, I hope to having a lasting impact on students that will use these computers for years to come. I hope to reach as many students affected as possible.</p>
